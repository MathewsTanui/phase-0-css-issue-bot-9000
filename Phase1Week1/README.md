Code Challenge Solutions
This repository contains solutions to three code challenges written in JavaScript.

Challenges
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This program prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the marks:

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector
This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines the demerit points based on the speed:

If the speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function prints: "License suspended".
Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This program calculates an individualâ€™s net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary based on the provided rates.
